Clique is a web application (heavily inspired by <b>[Watch2Gether](https://www.watch2gether.com/)</b>) for users wanting to watch videos in real-time together. It uses a CRUD account system which allow users who signed up to create rooms. Each room comes with custom video player widgets, chat integration, and a search bar.
